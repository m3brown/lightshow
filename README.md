Raspberry Pi + Unicornhat lightshow


This is a dump of scripts installed on a Raspberry Pi Zero.

In effect, these scripts created a "zuck light" type night light that displayed a rainbow of colors at a certain time in the morning.

Pairs with HomeKit on the local network as a simulated light bulb. This allows homekit to control the night light schedule.

Tools:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Unicornhat
- DietPi OS
