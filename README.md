Raspberry Pi + Unicornhat lightshow


This is a dump of scripts installed on a Raspberry Pi Zero.

In effect, these scripts create a "zuck light" type night light that display a rainbow of colors.

Pairs with HomeKit on the local network as a simulated light bulb. This allows HomeKit to control the night light schedule.

Tools:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Unicornhat
- DietPi OS
